yesterday s close call scared the living hell out of me because it happened all of a sudden and again i had no idea that aircraft x was there it s sector 2 s responsibility to ensure all conflicts are resolved in their air stratum before transferring communications to my frequency again this is this controller s second close call in less than a month something really needs to be done before her actions result in a catastrophic event,,zma controller reported of a conflict between two aircraft controller received an aircraft with a conditional clearance to descend minutes later the pilot reports leaving cruise altitude for new altitude conflict alert immediately goes off due to traffic 2 000 feet below controller stops aircraft altitude and issues traffic reporter stated this all happened in another sector and should have been resolved first before the transfer of communications,yesterday i was working sector 20 and aircraft x checked in at fl360 with a clearance to cross osogy at fl240 about 5 minutes later aircraft x advises that he was beginning his descent to fl240 and i rogered him out of nowhere conflict alert activates and i tell aircraft x to amend altitude and maintain fl330 aircraft x initially did not respond and i told him again amend altitude maintain fl330 and he responded there was crossing traffic at his 11 to 12 o clock and less than a mile at fl320 aircraft y aircraft x had been given a descent clearance from the previous sector sector 2 to fl240 with converging traffic at fl320 i really think something needs to be done about the safety culture and the quality of air traffic controllers the particular controller working sector 2 this is not his first close call and i feel nowadays there s just no accountability or consequences for subpar performances i had no idea that aircraft y was on a converging course with aircraft x because my sector owns sfc 230 and i don t see limited data blocks until fl242 needless to say yesterday s close
