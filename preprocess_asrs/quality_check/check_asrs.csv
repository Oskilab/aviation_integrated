I IMMEDIATELY BANKED R TO PASS BEHIND THE CITATION AND AS IT FLEW BY; I READ ITS TAIL NUMBER RECOGNIZING IT TO BE AN XYZ COMPANY ACFT. I ESTIMATE THE CITATION WAS LESS THAN 100 YARDS FROM MY ACFT AT MY ALT. I CAME UP ON APCH CTL FREQ AND INDICATED THAT 'I WAS ALMOST JUST RUN OVER BY A CITATION.' THE CTLR INDICATED THAT THE TWR CTLR SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE CITATION FROM MY POS. AS I UNDERSTOOD HIM; HE INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A POINTER ON MY RADAR TARGET. (I ASSUME THAT IS SOME TYPE OF INDICATION ON THE RADAR SCREEN.) I INDICATED THAT THE CONFLICT HAD BEEN WAY TOO CLOSE AND HE AGREED. I LATER LEARNED THAT THE CITATION WHICH HAD DEPARTED FROM PORT COLUMBUS (IFR) WAS CLRED TO 5000 FT; THROUGH MY ALT. THIS NMAC WAS SECONDS (AT MOST) AWAY FROM BECOMING A DISASTER WHICH WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE LIVES OF AT LEAST 3 PERSONS. IN THAT THE CITATION WAS UNANNOUNCED BY APCH; WAS UNEXPECTED AND WAS APCHING MY ACFT FROM BELOW AND THE R; IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE UNTIL IT FILLED MY WINDSHIELD.

I was assigned a discreet transponder code and proceeded directly towards ZZZ. En route; I picked up the ZZZ ATIS on a second radio and never stopped monitoring Approach on my primary radio. I fly in this airspace frequently with ZZZ probably being the second most frequently used airport after my home base. I however do not frequently fly the leg of ZZZ1 to ZZZ; or approach ZZZ from the Northwest. The ATIS at ZZZ usually notes whether or not [a local] Heliport is active. This evening the ATIS made no mention of the class D at [the heliport] being active. The Approach frequency sounded a little busier than usual and as I proceeded to approach ZZZ I jumped on a lull in radio traffic to ask if Approach wanted me to switch over to Tower. The controller immediately advised me to squawk 1200 and terminated services. When I switched over to Tower; the tower controller asked if I was the aircraft that had already entered his class D airspace. I advised him that Approach had dropped me only moments beforehand and did so after I had already entered his airspace. He asked if I had been cleared into [the] Heliport's adjacent airspace. I told him that I thought the ATIS omission of [the heliport's] status meant that the airspace was inactive. He reviewed the ATIS tape and concurred that the status was not playing back on the recorded loop due to a technical problem. I believe the approach controller may have been too busy to monitor my movements and should have dropped me earlier. My aircraft was never in conflict with any other aircraft and I don't believe anyone was ever in any danger. I believe this was a confluence of events and errors; including on my part; that led to an inadvertent airspace incursion. I should have made sure that the Heliport was 'cold' and contacted Approach earlier about my need to contact Tower.,,,,A Piper PA-28 pilot reported two airspace incursions using flight following due to the lack of a timely ATC handoff; and an ATIS information problem.,TRACON ZZZ,,,False,,,False,,,False,,,False,,,False,,,False,ZZZ,TRACON,False,,,False,,,False,,,False,,,False,,,False

Aircraft X was leveled at FL230 for a couple of minutes and checked on my frequency declaring an emergency. The other Sector's D-Side called me to ask whether or not Aircraft X was on my frequency because they were unable to communicate with the pilot. I advised them that the aircraft had returned to my frequency with an emergency. When Aircraft X checked on the frequency; he declared an emergency and reported descending. The Supervisor on duty was called and notified about the emergency. About 20 miles behind the emergency aircraft was Aircraft Y climbing to FL230 and about 15 miles behind that aircraft was a flight of two climbing to the block FL200-FL220. I requested and was given a D-Side to coordinate the emergency information. Aircraft X was asked nature of emergency (responding with Hydraulics problem; 2 souls on board; fuel remaining) and if requesting assistance on the ground (no assistance needed on the ground). Aircraft Y was stopped at FL210 for the emergency aircraft's decent and turned 30 degrees right for the emergency traffic. The emergency aircraft; Aircraft X; was then cleared to descend to 16;000FT direct the Air Force Base then turned to a 170 heading for the traffic. Aircraft X continued his descent and conflict alert was depicted between Aircraft X (emergency aircraft) and Aircraft Y at approximately FL210. All of the coordination was accomplished and Aircraft X was handed-off and shortly switched to Approach. Aircraft X took the frequency change. Approach called and notified us that Aircraft X was not on their frequency but Aircraft X was observed continuing his descent. I then proceeded to try to contact Aircraft X but I received no reply. After a few attempts Approach notified us that Aircraft X was on their frequency. A few minutes later; Approach advised us that the emergency aircraft (Aircraft X) had landed safely. After further review; I was notified that there was a Proximity Error (PE) of 4.83 miles between the emergency aircraft (Aircraft X) and the departure aircraft (Aircraft Y).
